The overall objective of Cocoa4Future is to enhance the sustainability of cocoa farms while preserving the environment by tailoring cocoa cropping systems to the changing context in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. Our aim is to contribute to the agroecological transition of cocoa production in these countries by proposing research that will help trigger a shift towards production systems that are in tune with environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, social responsibility, and quality standards, including ethical imperatives.
