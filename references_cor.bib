  abstract = {Huit ans de travaux de recherche sur les services {\'e}cosyst{\'e}miques dans une grande ferme caf{\'e}i{\`e}re du Costa Rica (observatoire collaboratif Coffee-Flux, en syst{\`e}me agroforestier {\`a} base de caf{\'e}iers sous de grands arbres d'Erythrina poeppigiana, surface projet{\'e}e de couronne de l'ordre de 16 \%) ont sugg{\'e}r{\'e} plusieurs applications pour les agriculteurs et les d{\'e}cideurs. Il est apparu que de nombreux services {\'e}cosyst{\'e}miques d{\'e}pendaient des propri{\'e}t{\'e}s du sol (ici des Andisols), en particulier de l'{\'e}rosion, de l'infiltration, de la capacit{\'e} de stockage de l'eau et des {\'e}l{\'e}ments nutritifs. Nous confirmons qu'il est essentiel de lier les services hydrologiques et de conservation au type de sol en pr{\'e}sence. Une densit{\'e} ad{\'e}quate d'arbres d'ombrage (plut{\^o}t faible ici) permet de r{\'e}duire la s{\'e}v{\'e}rit{\'e} des maladies foliaires avec, en perspective, une r{\'e}duction de l'usage de pesticides-fongicides. Un simple inventaire de la surface basale au collet des caf{\'e}iers permet d'estimer la biomasse souterraine et la moyenne d'{\^a}ge d'une plantation de caf{\'e}iers, ce qui permet d'{\'e}valuer sa valeur marchande ou de planifier son remplacement. Le protocole de calcul actuel pour la neutralit{\'e} carbone des syst{\`e}mes agroforestiers ne prend en compte que les arbres d'ombrage, pas la culture intercalaire. Dans la r{\'e}alit{\'e}, si on inclut les caf{\'e}iers, on se rapproche tr{\`e}s probablement de la neutralit{\'e}. Des {\'e}valuations plus compl{\`e}tes, incluant les arbres, les caf{\'e}iers, la liti{\`e}re, le sol et les racines dans le bilan en carbone du syst{\`e}me agroforestier sont propos{\'e}es. Les arbres d'ombrage offrent de nombreux servies {\'e}cosyst{\'e}miques s'ils sont g{\'e}r{\'e}s de mani{\`e}re ad{\'e}quate dans le contexte local. Par rapport aux parcelles en plein soleil, nous montrons qu'ils r{\'e}duisent l'{\'e}rosion laminaire d'un facteur 2, augmentent la fixation de l'azote (N2) atmosph{\'e}rique et le pourcentage d'azote recycl{\'e} dans le syst{\`e}me, r{\'e}duisant ainsi les besoins en engrais. Ils r{\'e}duisent aussi la s{\'e}v{\'e}rit{\'e} des maladies foliaires, augmentent la s{\'e}questration de carbone, am{\'e}liorent le microclimat et att{\'e}nuent substantiellement les effets des changements climatiques.

We monitored microclimate, net primary productivity (NPP), CO2 and H2O fluxes in a semiarid agro-sylvo-pastoral system (Niakhar, Senegal), dominated by the multipurpose Faidherbia albida (FA) tree. Undercrops were mainly millet and peanut, under annual rotation. We scanned a 1.24 ha millet under FA plot with UAV photogrammetry in RGB, thermal infrared and multispectral bands. At harvest, we collected 12 subplots of 15 millet holes each, distributed either below the crown of FA, or at 2.5 x crown radius, or at 5 x crown radius. We separated all organs. The whole millet root system (0-200 cm) was sampled also in 2 m trenches, totalizing 4 millet holes, where all roots were sorted by layer. The whole plot harvest will allow extrapolating yield from subplots, through UAV images. Millet yield per unit ground area was about 3 times higher below FA, with still a positive influence at 2.5 x crown radius and less impacts of pests close to FA. In the trenches, we noted higher soil humidity and SOC close to the FA trunks. This observatory is open for collaboration.},

We set a new long-term observatory up for the monitoring and modelling of microclimate, GHG and deep SOC in a semi-arid agro-sylvo-pastoral system (Niakhar, S{\'e}n{\'e}gal), dominated by the multipurpose Faidherbia albida tree. Crops were mainly millet and peanut, under annual rotation. Transhumant livestock contributed largely to manure, SOM and soil fertility. Early 2018, we installed 3 eddy-covariance towers above (i) the whole mosaic, (ii) millet and (iii) peanut and monitored energy, CO2 balance and evapotranspiration for one full year. The mosaic ecosystem displayed low but significant CO2 and H2O fluxes during the dry season, owing to Faidherbia in leaf (Fig. 1). When rains resumed, the soil bursted a large amount of CO2. Just after the raising of millet, CO2 uptake by photosynthesis increased dramatically, then stabilized before harvest. However, this was compensated by large ecosystem respiration. The annual ecosystem CO2 balance was close to nil. This observatory is currently installing soil chambers for GHG fluxes, studying the horizontal variability of SOC by Vis-NIR and of deep soil roots and C using wells. Microclimate (land surface temperature, energy balance and gas exchanges) and light-use-efficiency will be mapped through 3D modelling (Charbonnier et al., 2017; Vezy et al., 2018).

  abstract = {Agroforestry systems (AFS) are complex to model mainly due to the high spatial variability induced by the shade trees. Recently, the microclimate and light heterogeneity issue in AFS has been addressed using the 3D ecophysiological process-based model MAESPA (Charbonnier et al., 2013; Vezy et al., 2018). MAESPA surpassed the classical sun/shade dichotomy in AFS (Charbonnier et al., 2014) and provided continuous maps of e.g. available light, light-use-efficiency and canopy temperature within Coffea Agroforestry Systems (CAS). A step further was to design a crop model for Coffea grown under agroforestry that would benefit from this continuum to estimate ecosystem services on the long term and under climate change scenarios. We designed DynA\_Cof, a new process-based growth and yield model to compute plot-scale net and gross primary productivity, carbon allocation, growth, yield, energy, and water balance of CAS according to shade tree species and management, while accounting for fine-scale spatial effects using MAESPA metamodels (Figure 1). DynA\_Cof satisfactorily simulated the daily plot-scale gross primary productivity (RMSE= 1.69 gC m-2 d-1 on 1562 days) and the energy and water balances (RMSE: AET= 0.63 mm d-1, H= 1.27 MJ m-2 d-1, Rn= 1.98 MJ m-2 d-1) compared to measurements from an eddy-flux tower in Aquiares (Costa Rica) and also the NPP for above and below-ground organs, coffee bean yield and shade tree wood production compared to a comprehensive database from this site.}

  abstract = {The DynACof model was designed to model coffee agroforestry systems and study the trade-offs to e.g. optimize the system facing climate changes. The model simulates net primary productivity (NPP), growth, yield, mortality, energy and water balance of coffee agroforestry systems according to shade tree species and management. Several plot-scale ecosystem services are simulated by the model, such as production, canopy cooling effect, or potential C sequestration. DynACof uses metamodels derived from a detailed 3D process-based model (MAESPA) to account for complex spatial effects, while running fast. It also includes a coffee flower bud and fruit cohort module to better distribute fruit carbon demand over the year, a key feature to obtain a realistic competition between sinks. The model was parameterized and evaluated using a highly comprehensive database on a coffee agroforestry experimental site in Costa Rica. The fluxes simulated by the model were close to the measurements over a 5-year period (nRMSE~=~26.27 for gross primary productivity; 28.22 for actual evapo-transpiration, 53.91 for sensible heat flux and 15.26 for net radiation), and DynACof satisfactorily simulated the yield, NPP, mortality and carbon stock for each coffee organ type over a 35-year rotation.},

  abstract = {Introduction  Light modelling at the scale of organs is essential to account accurately for the complex interactions between biophysical processes such as photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and energy balance. Yet, the calculation of radiative exchanges at fine scales is computationally-intensive and it remains a hindrance to a widespread use of FSPMs despite advances in light modelling using either radiosity (Chelle and Andrieu, 1998) or raytracing (Bailey, 2018). This study shows that simplifications based on the discretization of radiative fluxes allow processing radiative exchanges in a natural environment while maintaining good accuracy on the simulation of biophysical processes such as carbon assimilation.  Material and Methods  The present study is based on biophysical simulations performed using the ARCHIMED model. Incident radiation is depicted as a set of specular fluxes (i.e. parallel rays) in discrete directions using the sun direction for direct radiation and predefined 'turtle' directions for the diffuse radiation. The 'turtle' directions are obtained by splitting the sky hemisphere into sectors of equal solid angle (Dauzat et al, 2001). Optionally, direct radiation can be distributed in neighboring "turtle" sectors (turtle only). For each direction, the scene is projected on an image plane and the interception of incident light is deduced from rasterized pixel projections. Additionally, Z-Buffering gives the overlay of scene objects and, in this regard, pixels can be viewed as rays traced from outside down to the ground level. Light scattering can thus be processed similarly to raytracing. In the case of Lambertian objects, we further assume that all rays scattered by an object carry the same energy whatever the ``turtle'' direction. Net assimilation (An) is calculated with Farquhar's model (Farquhar et al. 1980), stomatal conductance with Medlyn's model (Medlyn et al. 2011) and the leaf temperature is found by solving the energy balance of the system. Simulations are run on a dense three-dimensional scene including two palms (Elaeis guineensis) with the following configuration: latitude= 15\textdegree, Day of year 71, time steps of 30mn, clearness index Kt= 0.5. A ``toricity'' option is used to generate a virtually infinite canopy. The number of ``turtle'' directions is set to 6, 16, 46 or 136. The sun position is either integrated into the turtle or separately computed. The pixel density ranges from 341 to 6821 pixels m-2. The reference outputs are obtained with the highest number of directions and pixels.  * Scene metrics: plot= 15.9m*9.2m, meshes= 24 863, triangles= 571 934, LAI= 3.2, leaflets= 24 493  Results and Discussions  Figure 1 (left, see poster) illustrates the effect of the number of discrete light directions on the estimation of biophysical processes in comparison with the reference of 136 directions. Sampling the sun direction provides best results since direct radiation largely contributes to the PAR irradiance, the energy load of leaflets and, finally, their assimilation. Bias remain low when the sun direction is not sampled except when the number of "turtle" directions is decreased to six. The dispersion of residuals remains quite limited for 46 directions, meaning that reliable values can be obtained at leaflet scale for such configuration. Figure 1 (right) shows that a low pixel density (682 pixels m-2, i.e. 50 000 pixels) is sufficient to get a relatively unbiased estimation of carbon assimilation at plot level, but a higher density is necessary to get reliable estimation at leaflet scale. The reference configuration in the left pane of Fig. 1 generates 68.5M rays for each time step and, since several hits are recorded per ray (6 on average) this generates about 5 sub-rays that are used for the calculation of light scattering. Running the complete simulation with the reference configuration from the right pane of Fig. 1 lasts \textasciitilde 3.4 min for each time step (23M rays). This time can be decreased to only 2 seconds per step by storing partial scene illumination for each direction, but this preliminary step can be time-consuming, mainly during the multiple scattering for the PAR and NIR ranges. A considerable shortening is expected by treating light exchanges using directional form factors between pairs of objects instead of propagating scattered light by individual rays.  Conclusion  Using discrete ordinates allows performing accurate and unbiased simulations of light interception. Biases arise when decreasing the number of directions but with limited consequences on carbon assimilation. Larger biases occur when pixel density is too low to sample correctly individual leaflets. A configuration with 46 turtle directions for depicting both direct and diffuse radiation and a pixel density of 682 pixels m-2 allows fast computations while providing sufficient information to get precise light budget at fine scales.

  abstract = {Functional-structural plant modelling approaches (FSPM) open the way for exploring the relationships between the 3D structure and the physiological functioning of plants in relation to environmental conditions. FSPMs can be particularly interesting when dealing with perennial crops like oil palm, for which research on innovative management practices requires long and expensive agronomic trials. The present study is part of the PalmStudio project, which aims at developing a FSPM for oil palm capable of producing virtual experiments to test the relevance of innovative management practices and/or design ideotypes. We propose a methodological framework which integrates architectural responses to planting density in an existing oil palm FSPM (Perez et al. 2018a b). Combining standard field phenotyping with Lidar-based derived measurements, we manage to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity of the main parameters required for the calibration of the 3D plant model. Density-based allometries of leaf geometry and biomass are then derived from the observed variations in phenotypic traits and integrated into the FSPM.  Our results illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of Lidar-based phenotyping of leaf geometrical traits. In average, we find less than 3\% error in leaf dimensions (i.e. rachis length) in comparison with traditional manual field measurements. The fast and efficient measurements of usually labour-intensive traits such as leaf curvature allowed to estimate the plasticity of leaf geometry in response to density. We find that the main traits affected by density were leaf dimensions (up to 15\% and 25\% of increase in rachis length and petiole length respectively) and curvature (15\% of increase in leaf erectness-related parameter), whereas other structural traits like the number of leaflets per leaf remained unchanged. Simple density-based allometric relationships were then modelled and combined with the existing allometric-based 3D oil palm model Vpalm (Perez et al. 2018a). These data also enable the development and the integration in Vpalm of a biomechanical model simulating leaf curvature. The methodology presented in this study paves the way for a rapid integration of phenotypic plasticity in FSPMs. Our FSPM is now able to estimate how planting density affect not only plant architecture but also functional processes such as carbon assimilation and transpiration using VPalm to build 3D mock-ups and ARCHIMED to simulate the biophysical processes. Ongoing research aims at coupling the current FSPM with a carbon allocation model (Pallas et al. 2013) to simulate the retroactions of functioning processes on plant architecture together with environmental and agronomic conditions.}

  abstract = {Abstract The mechanistic model GO+ describes the functioning and growth of managed forests based upon biophysical and biogeochemical processes. The biophysical and biogeochemical processes included are modelled using standard formulations of radiative transfer, convective heat exchange, evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, respiration, plant phenology, growth and mortality, biomass nutrient content, and soil carbon dynamics. The forest ecosystem is modelled as three layers, namely the tree overstorey, understorey and soil. The vegetation layers include stems, branches and foliage and are partitioned dynamically between sunlit and shaded fractions. The soil carbon submodel is an adaption of the Roth-C model to simulate the impact of forest operations. The model runs at an hourly time step. It represents a forest stand covering typically 1 ha and can be straightforwardly upscaled across gridded data at regional, country or continental levels. GO+ accounts for both the immediate and long-term impacts of forest operations on energy, water and carbon exchanges within the soil\textendash vegetation\textendash atmosphere continuum. It includes exhaustive and versatile descriptions of management operations (soil preparation, regeneration, vegetation control, selective thinning, clear-cutting, coppicing, etc.), thus permitting the effects of a wide variety of forest management strategies to be estimated: from close to nature to intensive. This paper examines the sensitivity of the model to its main parameters and estimates how errors in parameter values are propagated into the predicted values of its main output variables. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates an interaction between the sensitivity of variables, with the climate and soil hydraulic properties being dominant under dry conditions but the leaf biochemical properties being most influential with wet soil. The sensitivity profile of the model changes from short to long timescales due to the cumulative effects of the fluxes of carbon, energy and water on the stand growth and canopy structure. Apart from a few specific cases, the model simulations are close to the values of the observations of atmospheric exchanges, tree growth, and soil carbon and water stock changes monitored over Douglas fir, European beech and pine forests of different ages. We also illustrate the capacity of the GO+ model to simulate the provision of key ecosystem services, such as the long-term storage of carbon in biomass and soil under various management and climate scenarios.},
